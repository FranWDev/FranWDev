## 💼 Experience

### 🔹 Sagrera Canarias – Full-Stack Developer (Internship)  
*Apr 2025 – Jun 2025 | La Laguna*  
- Developed and deployed production features (B2B, store reviews system, recommendation algorithm, partner program, abandoned cart recovery).  
- Optimized critical processes with **CTEs**, reducing **+5000 SQL queries → 5**.  
- Improved performance of heavy tasks (**1h → 15s**).  
- Enhanced usability and mobile performance with **20+ UX/UI improvements**.  
- Delivered clear technical documentation and collaborated with non-technical teams.  
**Most important features:**
  - **Review System**: implemented a post-purchase feedback flow that automatically sent customers an email after receiving their order. Each email included a unique, single-use token to prevent spam. Submitted reviews were manually moderated in the backoffice before being published in a slider on the website.
  - **Partner Program**: implemented a loyalty/affiliation system with cross-registration. Customers could sign up either in the physical store or online, and their discount benefits were synchronized to work seamlessly in both channels.
  - **Abandoned Cart Recovery Module**: developed a backoffice tool that allowed sending personalized discount links to users who abandoned their carts. The link redirected them to a checkout page with all data prefilled and the discount applied, maximizing convenience and significantly increasing conversion
